i've been hacking around with getting the Joomla! CMS to install under Google App Engine.

One thing I ran into is that when connecting up to a GAE Cloud SQL server the connection format is different.

For the app that is running on GAE, you have to specify a socket instead of a host and port - and unfortunately GAE's socket naming convention is problematic.  For example, my socket is:
'/cloudsql/overnumerousness-site:joomla'

Note that there is a colon(:) in the name of the socket which causes problems as the Joomla MySQLI driver uses the colon as a separator - so it can't process that string properly.

In addition, when connecting to the Cloud SQL database from my local dev server, I need to use the ip address and port number.

Thanks to autoloading structure used by Joomla and the way GAE routes requests, it is fairly easy to handle this.

First I created a new database driver, JDatabaseDriverGaemysqli which extends JDatabaseDriverMysqli and overrides the driver name[gaemysqli] and uses a custom connect method where I embed a simple check to see if it is running from GAE or from my local.  I store the database server name in configuration.php as ipaddress|port|socket so I can parse it using | instead of : and set the appropriate connection variables.

I create that driver file in my own joomla libraries folder: gae/libraries/joomla/database/driver - so all I need to do is call JLoader::registerPrefix('J', GAEJOOMLALIBS, false, true);
in my GAE script before loading the appropriate index.php file.  This lets me push my custom files/classes to the head of the line for autoloading.

Since Joomla! doesn't need to do any checking of "valid" database drivers when it runs, it just uses whatever class name was defined in configuration.php - it either works or it doesn't.  So for 95% of the Joomla code, this is all I need to do.

Then I hit the 5% of the code where this fails.  :-)  The Joomla Configuration program has a number of hiccups:
1) It filters database drivers, cache engines, and session storage engines so only the ones from the files stored in the
